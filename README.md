# Repo Wars

Welcome to **Repo Wars**, the ultimate competitive coding challenge where teams battle for codebase supremacy! Gather your team, strategize, and improve the codebase to earn points and emerge victorious.

## How to Play

### 1. Form Teams
Assemble your squad of developers. Any number from 2 to 5 members per team is recommended.

### 2. Choose a Battlefield
Fork the designated starting repository. This could be a simple project with intentional issues or a template for a specific challenge.

### 3. The War Begins
Over a set time period (e.g., a week), teams strategize and submit pull requests to improve the codebase.

### 4. Scoring
Points are awarded for:
   - Successfully merged pull requests
   - Resolved issues
   - Passing code quality tests (these will need to be set up)
   - Positive code reviews from other teams (encourages sportsmanship)

### 5. Victory!
The team with the highest score at the end of the time period wins.

## Rules

- **Collaboration is Key:** Strategize within your team in issues, discussions, etc.
- **Fair Play:** No sabotaging other teams' branches. Focus on improving your own codebase.
- **Respect the Code:** Clear commit messages, adherence to established style guides, etc.
- **Time Limits:** All activity must take place within the designated competition window.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the starter repository.
2. Set up any test suites or quality checkers needed for scoring.
3. Begin planning your strategy!

## Technologies

- GitHub (for code submission, tracking, and collaboration)
- Python (used in the starter project)
- Automated testing tools like pytest (for running tests in `tests/test_main.py`)
- Continuous Integration setup with GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

## Prizes

The glory of victory and bragging rights on the hallowed battlefields of GitHub... (plus any other cool prizes you might have for the winning team!)

## Let the Code Wars Begin!

### Optional Additions

- **Themes:** "Fix the Buggiest Codebase", "Fastest Feature Implementation", etc.
- **Judges:** Developers not participating could score PRs based on elegance, maintainability, etc.
- **Live Leaderboard:** A simple script in `leaderboard/update_leaderboard.py` updates a leaderboard on the main README for that real-time competitive feel.

Happy coding, and may the best team win!
